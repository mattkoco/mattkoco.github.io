        <h1>Evils in the Russo-Ukranian War</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This conflict's most prominent evils are Social Evil as caused by world leaders, as well as Physical and Ecological Suffering. Since the war is being fought in modern cities, things like artillery fire and rockets have caused buildings to collapse and forests to be destroyed. Social Evil is caused by world leader's unwillingness to try to make amends, and decision to force people to die.</p>
            <p>A prime example of this is Russia and North Korea, who are sending young people, not much older than high school Juniors and Seniors, into the frontlines to die. North Korea is, at the most basic level, trading human lives for a stronger alliance with Russia. Death is caused on the Ukrainian side as well by people who feel they cannot flee their home and have no other choice but to stay and fight, and are killed due to this decision.</p>
